# LCG Random Number Generator in Go ðŸŽ²

## About

This repository contains an implementation of the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) for generating pseudorandom numbers in Go. LCG is a simple and efficient algorithm used in various applications due to its ease of implementation and reasonably good statistical properties.

## Features

- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can specify their values for the modulus, multiplier, increment, and seed.
- **Default Configuration:** A default LCG setup is provided for quick usage.
- **Range-Based Random Numbers:** Generate random integers within a specified range.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, follow the installation steps below:

#### Installing Go

1. **Download Go:**
   - Visit the [official Go downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/).
   - Select the appropriate package for your operating system and architecture.

2. **Install Go:**
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your platform.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run `go version`.
   - You should see the installed version of Go displayed.

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your-project
   ```

## Usage

To use the random number generator:

1. **Import the Package:**
   - Include the RNG package in your Go file.
     ```go
     import "path/to/your-project/rng"
     ```

2. **Create an RNG Instance:**
   - You can create a new instance of the RNG with or without custom parameters.
     ```go
     generator := rng.NewRandomNumberGenerator() // With default settings
     // OR
     generator := rng.NewRandomNumberGenerator(modulus, multiplier, increment, seed) // With custom settings
     ```

3. **Generate Random Numbers:**
   - Use the `GetRandomInt` method to generate random integers within a specified range.
     ```go
     randomNumber := generator.GetRandomInt(min, max)
     ```
